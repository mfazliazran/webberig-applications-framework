#summary How to perform MySQL queries

= Introduction =
The framework includes functions that make MySQL queries safe and easy. It allows you to parameterize queries.

= Details =
To create queries, you need to have access to the Waf object. Pages and applets are in the scope of the Waf object, so you can use {{{$this}}}. If not, you need to get the Waf object. It uses a singleton pattern:
{{{
$f = Waf::Singleton();
}}}

Once you have the reference to the Waf Object ({{{$f}}} or {{{$this}}}), you can perform queries. Consider this example:
{{{
$qry = $f->NewQuery("SELECT * FROM %PRE%users WHERE id = @id");
$qry->setParam("id", 1);
$ret = 

}}}

#summary Creating your own application

= Introduction =

This page will explain how you can start your own application using the framework.

= Details =

== Step 1: Downloading the framework == 
There aren't any files available for download, so you must get the latest trunk from the Subversion repository. The easiest way is to perform an SVN EXPORT from the trunk:
{{{
http://webberig-applications-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
}}}

== Step 2: Creating a database ==
We're using MySQL Workbench to maintain a database model. You can find the model in the root directory, named waf-database-model.mwb. 

  * Open the file using MySQL workbench
  * Go to the menu Database > Forward engineer (or press _CTRL + G_)
  * Make sure the option "Generate INSERT Statements for Tables" is enabled.
  * Complete the wizard

A database should be created on the MySQL server you provided. If you enabled the "Generate INSERT statements", there should be some initial records already present:
  * A 'root user' role, which has access to the roles module
  * A user '*admin*' with password '*Waf1234*'

== Step 3: Configure the application ==
Go to the file _/application/settings.php_ and change this file with the right settings. The most important settings are the MySQL connection settings and the BasePath.

== Step 4: Run your application ==
That's it! You should now be able to run your application through your web server!

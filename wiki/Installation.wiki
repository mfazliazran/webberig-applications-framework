#summary Creating your own application

= Introduction =

This page will explain how you can start your own application using the framework.

= Details =

== Step 1: Downloading the framework == 
Download the latest version of the framework [here http://webberig-applications-framework.googlecode.com/files]

It's highly recommended to use a stable release (minor version = even number). If you like to do some beta testing, you should download the latest unstable release (minor version = odd number).

== Step 2: Creating a database ==
Create a database and run the structure.sql file included in the package.

The script also inserts some initial records:
  * A 'root user' role, which has access to the roles module
  * A user '*admin*' with password '*Waf1234*'

== Step 3: Configure the application ==
Go to the file _/application/settings.php_ and change this file with the right settings. The most important settings are the MySQL connection settings and the BasePath.

== Step 4: Run your application ==
That's it! You should now be able to run your application through your web server!
